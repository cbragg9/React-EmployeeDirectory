## Features

Given a table of 200 random employees, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user will be able to:

- Sort the table (ascending/descending) by employee Name, Phone, Email, and Date of Birth 

- Filter the employees by Name

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.  

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
